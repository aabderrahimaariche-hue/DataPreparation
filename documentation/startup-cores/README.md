## 🌍 The Universal Framework

All sectors use the same foundation:

```
INTELLIGENCE-READABLES-WRITABLES (Universal Pattern)
│
├─ Intelligence (IDs) = Unique identifiers
│  Examples: User ID, Patient ID, Movie ID, Entity ID
│  Question: "What are we learning about?"
│
├─ Readables (Categories) = Observable attributes  
│  Examples: Genres, Symptoms, Features, Attributes
│  Question: "What do we observe?"
│
└─ Writables (Values) = Numeric metrics
   Examples: Ratings, Recovery Days, Sales, Outcomes
   Question: "What are we trying to predict?"
```

**Key Insight**: Same functions work across ALL domains when using this structure!

```
MovieLens         Healthcare        E-commerce         AI/ML
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User ID       →  Patient ID     →  Customer ID    →  Entity ID
Genre         →  Symptom        →  Category       →  Feature
Rating        →  Outcome        →  Purchase       →  Target

SAME FUNCTIONS, DIFFERENT DATA, DIFFERENT MODELS!
```
